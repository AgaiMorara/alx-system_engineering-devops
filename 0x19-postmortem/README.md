Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: July 10, 2024, 09:00 UTC
End: July 10, 2024, 10:15 UTC
Impact:
The web applicationâ€™s admin panel was down, with 90% of admin users experiencing errors when attempting to access management features.
Admins were unable to perform critical tasks, delaying updates and content management.
Root Cause:
A typo in the PHP configuration file caused by a manual edit from an admin, leading to syntax errors and server misconfigurations.
Timeline
09:00 UTC - Issue detected via an alert for a high number of 500 Internal Server Error responses on the admin panel.
09:07 UTC - Engineering team notified and began investigating PHP application logs, suspecting a code deployment issue.
09:12 UTC - Initial assumption focused on recent code changes, but no errors were found in the deployment logs.
09:32 UTC - Misleading debugging paths included database integrity checks and server memory diagnostics.
09:45 UTC - Issue escalated to the DevOps team for deeper analysis of the Apache server and configuration files.
09:52 UTC - DevOps discovered syntax errors in the PHP configuration file caused by a recent manual edit.
09:57 UTC - Configuration file corrected, and Apache server restarted.
10:15 UTC - Service fully restored, with monitoring confirming normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
A manual edit by an admin introduced a typo in the PHP configuration file, which resulted in syntax errors that prevented Apache from properly processing PHP requests.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by identifying and correcting the syntax errors in the configuration file. The Apache server was then restarted to apply the corrected settings, restoring full functionality to the admin panel.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements Needed:
Access Control: Limit admin access to critical configuration files to prevent unauthorized or accidental changes.
Change Management: Implement a formal change management process for all configuration changes.
Error Monitoring: Enhance error monitoring to detect configuration-related issues faster.
Action Items:
Review Admin Permissions: Restrict access to configuration files to authorized personnel only.
Implement Change Approval: Establish a change approval process requiring peer review for configuration changes.
Add Syntax Validation: Integrate syntax validation checks into the deployment pipeline to catch errors before they affect production.
Training Session: Conduct a training session for admins on the importance of configuration management and error prevention.
